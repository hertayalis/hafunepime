Now, after weeks of exploring this massive game world — and equally massive, complex story — I can say that I’m glad I took the leap, as Xenoblade Chronicles 3 may very well be the best of the series.</description></item><item><title>The Cast of Moonlight Reacts to Their Calvin Klein Ads</title><link>/moonlight-cast-calvin-klein-ads-reaction.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/moonlight-cast-calvin-klein-ads-reaction.html</guid><description>Last week, Calvin Klein turned heads for all the right reasons when it debuted a new campaign starring the cast of Moonlight.
